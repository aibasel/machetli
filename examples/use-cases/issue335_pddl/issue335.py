# A note on successor generators:
# For this example, we chose to use two successor generators (RemoveObjects
# and ReplaceLiteralsWithTruth) that are already implemented and can be used
# to transform PDDL tasks. Implementations of the SuccesssorGenerator class
# are required to have a *get_successors(state)* function that returns a generator
# of states which are considered the successors. The way a successor generator
# is implemented determines how the state and your run(s) look(s) after the search
# is completed. Like the evaluator, successor generators may have to be
# tailored exactly to your use case.
